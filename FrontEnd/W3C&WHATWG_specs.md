# W3C: World Wide Web Consortium

The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.

# WHATWG: Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group

The WHATWG was formed in response to the slow development of World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) Web standards and W3C's decision to abandon HTML in favor of XML-based technologies.[5]

Specifications

The WHATWG has been actively working on several documents.

* HTML (formerly known as HTML5,[12] and Web Applications 1.0 before that) is the fifth major version of the HTML specification and has been adopted by the W3C as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group. The renaming from HTML5 was part of change announced on 19 January 2011 that the specification for HTML will be a living document that will have continuous changes as necessary.[13]
* Fetch Standard,[14] which "defines requests, responses, and the process that binds them: fetching.". The fetch standard defines the 'fetch' JavaScript API, and supersedes the HTML5 fetch functionality, CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.
* Web Workers[15] defines an API that enables ECMAScript to use multi-core CPUs more effectively.
* Microdata Vocabularies[16] defines vocabularies for use with the HTML5 Microdata feature.
* Web Forms 2.0[17] is an update to HTML forms. The spec will no longer be developed standalone, as the features have been folded into HTML5.
